The main code is in the main.py file and the google colab copy is in main.ipynb.
I used google colab notebook for work.


since nltk word tokenizer was splitting "aren't" into "are" and "n't" i wrote custom code to tokenize the word.

since in the instructions it was not mentioned not to count numbers as words i let it be. but in the function sentiment analysis and sentence analysis there is a optional argument avoid_numbers which if set True it will not consider numbers while calculating


I used only the personal pronouns given in Instructions.
